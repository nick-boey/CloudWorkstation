# Cloud Workstation

Notes:

- Using container registries etc. didn't end up working
- Used an Azure VM instead to host Coder
- Using Docker with Envbuilder to use the devcontainer that is set up in the Sharpitect repository.

TODO:

- [ ] Create Terraform script to set up Virtual Machine
- [ ] Update template to be more specific
